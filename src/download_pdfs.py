📥 PDF Download Stub

This script is a placeholder for downloading raw newspaper PDFs.

Due to paywalls, Telegram restrictions, and inconsistent sources, 
this step is **manual or custom per user**.

🔧 You can write your own script using:

- requests + BeautifulSoup (for public PDFs)
- telethon (for Telegram-hosted PDFs)
- selenium (for interactive websites)
- APIs from newspaper archives (if available)

📁 Expected Output:
Download all PDFs into → `data/raw_pdfs/`
Name format: `TH_Delhi_05_07_2025.pdf`

📝 Tip:
You can share your download tool in `tools/download_helpers/` and link it here.
